To flash the esp32 you will need to download from link https://www.espressif.com/en/support/download/all
and download the  "Flash Download Tools" version V3.8.7 or later which normally end up in your pc download folder.

Then unzip the package and with the unzipped folder go all the way up to the level where  the flash_download_tool_3.8.7.exe file
or later is 
Double click on it and in the pop-up window select ESP32 / develop work mode, click ok It will open an new pop-up and 
enter following info as to get a reference to the 4 file with you will need to extract to a folder

x bootloader_dio_40m.bin	@ 0x1000
x partitions.bin			@ 0x8000
x boot_app0.bin			    @ 0xe000
x firmware.bin			    @ 0x10000

make sure they are selected by checkboxes left side (x), fields right side will then color green selection to set/observe are 40MHz, DIO, 32Mbit

Then at the right side bottom select the proper com port (it was com3 in my case) and a baudrate of 460800 And hit start button 
and if all is well it should populate some info in the with /empty boxes and say 'finished'
And you may close the flash tool. In future I will just send an new zip file which holds next version and you Should be all set to upgrade it.

Then open a terminal emulator like Tera Term @ baudrate of 115200 and you should get output from our dev brd and observe it's measured 
data / pause/resume and set it's gain, see it's printout

Then I took a spare board out of the 4 unused brds and cut off the analog section and used that as shielding On top of the reel analog section 
and used two bots/nuts as to separated / fasten it, seems to work fine.
